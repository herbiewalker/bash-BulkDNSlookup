Here's a Bash script that accomplishes requirements for bulk DNS lookup. 
I've added comments to explain each section of the code
Save this script to a file (e.g., bulk_dns_lookup.sh) and make it executable using chmod +x bulk_dns_lookup.sh. 
Then you can run the script and follow the prompts to perform bulk DNS lookups and save the results in CSV and TXT files.
